# Social-Network-API

In this challenge I utilize [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react, and create a friends list. I also utilized [Express.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs) to route endpoints and [Mongoose ODM](https://mongoosejs.com/) for object modeling.

## User Story
    
    AS A social media startup
    I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
    SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
